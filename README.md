# FootlessParser

FootlessParser is a simple and pretty naive implementation of a parser combinator in Swift. It is a work in progress and not very useful at the moment. More info about the development can be found [here](http://blog.nottoobadsoftware.com/footlessparser/).


### Setup

1. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) if not already installed.
1. Download/clone FootlessParser.
1. Run `carthage bootstrap --platform Mac` from the root folder. *

*_Several of the frameworks FootlessParser uses will not compile for iOS at the moment, support for iOS will be added when that has been fixed._
